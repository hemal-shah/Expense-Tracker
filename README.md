#Expense Tracker

This is a practice app I have been creating to experiment with features of RecyclerView.
Currently it's in primitive stages, but I have plans to add following features.
- [x] Content Provider 
- [x] Link Content Provider with Cursor Loader 
- [ ] Swipe to dismiss feature.
- [ ] Material Design touch & expand feature like in Inbox app.
